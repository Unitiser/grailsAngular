# Simple grails application that uses AngularJs

This application was build to test how AngularJs could be integrated in a grails 3.0.4 project. I did not use any of the angular plugins that already exists grails. It is my understanding that the plugin simplify the distribution of templates and the CRUD operations. Right now, we access the templates and the actions via the same controller.

This application was build in a single afternoon, so please be gentle.

I welcome anyone to leave comments!
